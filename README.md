# Overview

SauvolaNet is an end-to-end document binarization solutions. It optimal three hyper-parameters of classic Sauvola algriothim. Compare with exisiting solutions, SauvolaNet has follow advantages:

- SauvolaNet do not have any Pre/Post-processing
- SauvolaNet has comparable performance with SoTA
- SauvolaNet has super light network horticulture, faster than SoTA

# Dependency

SauvolaNet is written in the TensorFlow.
  
  - TensorFlow-GPU: 2.3.0
  
Other versions might also work, but are not tested.

# Demo
